<h4> Thrifting and vintage shopping is a very integral part of the young Houston culture. Many people consider resale shopping a unique experience when done in Houston due to the many shops that are located around the city, and the many unique pieces that still have their history and quality. Even coming in with $30 can get you good deals on name brands at many of these stores.</h4>


<h3><span>Houston Markets<span></h3>
<h4> In the many years of this city's culture and history, an event that is crucial to Houstonians is the Houston Markets. These markets aren't just exclusive to one event or for one type of selling. For instance, there's a retail mart that takes place seven days a week exclusively for small businesses for people who want to shop small. A type of market that is special to the city is the Farmers Market; a thriving market that has been around and flourished since 1941! It is unique a shopping experience that shows off produce and products all locally sourced and made with the hands of people with dreams. </h4>
